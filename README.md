# Movie Recommendations with Collaborative Filtering using TensorFlow

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Objective

In this project, we will delve into the implementation of a collaborative filtering learning algorithm and its application to a movie ratings dataset. The central objective of this collaborative filtering recommender system is to generate two essential vectors: one for each user, representing their movie preferences as a 'parameter vector,' and another for each movie, referred to as a feature vector, which encapsulates some descriptive aspects of the movie.

By calculating the dot product of these two vectors and adding a bias term, we aim to estimate the rating a user might assign to a particular movie. Through this report, we will explore the mechanics of the collaborative filtering algorithm and demonstrate how it can effectively provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie characteristics.
